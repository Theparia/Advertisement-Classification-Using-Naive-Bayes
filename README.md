# Advertisements Classification using Naive Bayes and Bag of Words Model

The project is based on a dataset containing advertisements from [Divar](https://divar.ir/s/tehran), a platform for posting advertisements. The dataset comprises both a training set (`divar_train.csv`) and a test set (`divar_test.csv`). The goal is to use the **Naive Bayes Classifier** along with the **Bag of Words Model** to analyze and categorize these advertisements.


### Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes Classifier assumes independence among predictors and utilizes Bayes' Theorem to classify data. It is a widely used classification technique in various domains due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### Bag of Words Model
The Bag of Words Model is a common representation technique used in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this project, it will be utilized to preprocess and represent the text data from advertisements.
